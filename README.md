## Projects

### Project 1: MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
A content based optimized Machine Learning model for recommending similar kind of movies from a given dataset, utilizing advanced preprocessing, and Text Vectorization, and optimization methods.
The project aims to deploy a scalable system for different users to be recommended movies based on their search input and the
potential impact of machine learning-based implementation.

- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Flask
- **Repository:** [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Avjt2214/movie_recommender)

### Project 2: Image Steganography with Python
A project demonstrates a simple implementation of image steganography using Python and OpenCV. The application allows users to hide (encrypt) a secret message inside an image and later retrieve (decrypt) the message using a simple UI built with Tkinter.

- **Technologies:** Python, OpenCV
- **Repository:** [Image Steganography](https://github.com/Avjt2214/Steganography)
